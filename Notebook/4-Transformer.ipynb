    "**In this notebook, we leverage a transformer-based model to perform sentiment analysis on hotel reviews from New York City. The process includes the following steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Preparation: The notebook begins by loading a dataset that includes pre-processed hotel reviews with previously identified topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentiment Analysis Setup: We use the Hugging Face transformers library to set up a sentiment analysis pipeline. The DistilBERT model, fine-tuned on the SST-2 dataset for sentiment classification, is chosen for this task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentiment Prediction: The model is applied to the text data, predicting sentiment labels (e.g., positive or negative) along with confidence scores. These results are added back to the original dataset for further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Results Integration: The dataset is updated with the sentiment labels and scores, providing a comprehensive view of customer sentiments associated with each review. This enriched data can be used for deeper analysis, including correlating sentiments with specific topics or hotel attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook concludes by saving the sentiment-enriched dataset, setting the stage for further exploration and insights into customer satisfaction and hotel performance."
